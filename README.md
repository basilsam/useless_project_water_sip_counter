# Water Sip Counter ðŸŽ¯

**Team Name:** MUNGIKKAPPAL
**Team Lead:** Basil Sam Abraham â€” CUSAT

## Project Description

A fun web app that **counts how many sips you take to finish a glass/bottle of water**.
It works in three modes:

1. **Manual mode** â€” tap a button each time you sip.
2. **Timer mode** â€” log sips automatically at set intervals.
3. **Camera mode** â€” detects when you move a bottle/glass to your mouth and logs a sip automatically.

Your sip history is displayed in a chart, stored locally, and can be exported as CSV.

---

## Problem

Nobody actually *needs* to know how many sips they takeâ€¦ but what if you could?
We solve the worldâ€™s most unnecessary hydration mystery.

---

## Solution

We track each sip in real-time and show patterns over time.
We even use **MediaPipe + TensorFlow object detection** to spot when youâ€™re drinking, no button press required.

## Installation

```bash
git clone https://github.com/<yourusername>/water-sip-counter.git
cd water-sip-counter
npm install
```

---

## Run

```bash
npm run dev

```

---

## How to Use

1. **Manual mode** â€” Click the "Log Sip" button.
2. **Timer mode** â€” Enter seconds, click "Start".
3. **Camera mode** â€” Toggle camera on:

   * Detects **glass/bottle in hand** + **movement toward mouth**.
   * Logs a sip when conditions match.
4. Export history via **"Export CSV"**.

---

## Implementation

* **Detection**:

  * COCO-SSD runs every **10 frames** to detect a bottle/cup.
  * MediaPipe Hands tracks hand position.
  * When the object is near mouth landmarks (FaceMesh), it counts as a sip.
* **Cooldown**: 2 seconds between sips to avoid duplicates.
* **Storage**: Sips are saved in `localStorage`.

If you want, I can now package **all source code for these components** exactly in this structure so you can run it right away in the hackathon.

Do you want me to go ahead and write **the full working code** for `CameraSipDetector.jsx` with bottle detection + movement toward mouth? Thatâ€™s the most technical part.
